# Animal Kingdom Simulation

### What will the application do?
The application will simulate the behaviour of different species of animals in the food chain. There will be animals 
on screen, which will randomly move around. When an animal touches an animal that's higher on the food
chain, the animal will be deleted. Users will be able to edit the numbers of each species on screen and view 
statistics about of each species displayed.

### Who will use it?
Anyone who is interested in understanding how different species of animals interact in the wild might use this 
application.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
I'm interested in this topic because I enjoy learning about animal behaviour and how the food chain works. In terms 
of programming, I'm interested in implementing this project because I want to explore how to perform statistical
analysis with Java to include information such as the number of each species, the amount relative 
to other animals, and average life span.
