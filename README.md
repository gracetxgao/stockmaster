# Stock Market Simulator

## Description

### What will the application do?
The application will allow users to learn about the stock market by simulating the buying and selling of stocks, bonds,
and mutual funds. Users will be able to view lists of stocks with their current prices and growth rates, and decide
whether they would like to buy or sell. The user will be able to choose when to move forward in time, and the prices of 
each stock will update as time passes.

### Who will use it?
Anyone who is interested in learning about the stock market might use this application.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me because I'd like to learn more about the stock market and maybe pursue a career in
related industries. In terms of programming, I'm interested in implementing this project because I want to 
explore how to perform statistical analysis with Java to include information about growth trends of
each stock and the user's profit.
